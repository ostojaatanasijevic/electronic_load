Open hardware modular electronic load

Modular nature of the instrument is based around dual darlington module boards, each containing 2 of the schematic blocks shown below ![](https://github.com/ostojaatanasijevic/electronic_load/blob/master/electronic_load_module/module_half.png)
This module is designed for 8A and 2V - 60V operation with a maximum disipation of around 100W.

Control signals are generated by the general purpose front panel module. Using a panel with 12 bit ADC and DAC yealds 1 mA control
and sense accuracy.

Vcesat shortcoming of the darlington modules can be overcome by an addition of a singular mosfet based module. 

Additinal modules like the analog mixer circuit for fast CR and CP modes are in the works.
